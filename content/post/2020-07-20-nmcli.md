## Issues

1. The interface state is unmanaged even after setting managed yes

A device can be unmanaged for multiple reasons. Only some of those reasons can
be undone via `nmcli dev set`. for example, if it's unmanaged due to
NM_CONTROLLED=no in an ifcfg file, then you cannot overrule that. on the other
hand, if the device is unmanaged due to an udev rule or due to
"device.managed" in NetworkManager.conf, then it can be overruled via
D-Bus/nmcli.

Even you have a ifcfg-eth2 which doesn't has NM_CONTROLLED=no. If you have
a file ifcfg-eth2.bak with NM_CONTROLLED=no. You will also got this issue.

2. What's the difference between DEVICE=eth2 and NAME=eth2?

NAME= is the (optional) name of the profile. DEVICE= is the (optional) name of
the interface to which it applies (or, in case of software devices like
bridge/bond, it's the name of the created device)

3. Is it possible to make it connected without config any ip address? to avoid
state connecting (getting IP configuration).

`nmcli c modify eth2 ipv4.addresses "192.168.2.1/24" ipv4.method manual`
doesn't work as modifying a profile does not change the device. We need also
do `nmcli connection up eth2` to make the changed applied.
