title: Get start with XDP in 20m
date: 2020-12-17
---

The XDP(eXpress Data Path) is a powerful new network feature in Linux based on
eBPF, that enables high-performance programmable access to networking packets
before they enter the networking stack. But it also has a high start curve to
learn, many developers have written introduction blogs for this feature. e.g.
Paolo Abeni's [Using XDP in RHEL8](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/12/06/achieving-high-performance-low-latency-networking-with-xdp-part-1/)
and Toke's [Using XDP in RHEL8](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/using-express-data-path-xdp-red-hat-enterprise-linux-8).

As the XDP is a new technology and is still in fast-moving. The eBPF/XDP coding
format and style are also changing. So developers are trying to make it easy
to write. Some tools/frameworks are created to help develop BPF applications.
e.g. [libbpf](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf.git), [xdp-tools](https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tools)
which we will use in this blog.

In this blog, I will introduce how to start with XDP program with 4 steps:

  1. Write a small program to drop everything to show what a simple XDP program looks like
      * What a samll program looks like
      * How to build and dump bpf object
      * How to load bpf object
      * How to show bpf programs
      * How to unload bpf object
  2. Extend the program to let you know how to deal with specific packets
  3. Use a packet counter to show how to use BPF maps
  4. Add a userspace tool to show how to load the BPF program with customer tools

The reader needs to be familiar with C code and IP header structures.
All examples are tested with RHEL-8.3

The article should take you about 30m.

## Prerequisites

As a preparation of the developing environment. We should install the following packages.

`$ sudo dnf install clang llvm gcc libbpf libbpf-devel libxdp libxdp-devel xdp-tools bpftool kernel-headers`

## Task 1: XDP: Drop everything

### Task 1.1: Write a Hello World program
First, let's start with a simple XDP program in C:

```
#include <linux/bpf.h>
#include <bpf/bpf_helpers.h>

SEC("xdp_drop")
int xdp_drop_prog(struct xdp_md *ctx)
{
	return XDP_DROP;
}

char _license[] SEC("license") = "GPL";
```

The `linux/bpf.h` is provided by the kernel-header package, which defines
all the supported bpf helpers and xdp_actions, like `XDP_DROP` in this example.

The `bpf/bpf_helpers.h` is provided by libbpf-devel, which provided some
useful eBPF macros, like `SEC` in this example. The `SEC`, short for section,
is used to place a fragment of the compiled object in different ELF sections,
which we could see in the later `llvm-objdump` result.

In function `xdp_drop_prog()` we have a parameter `struct xdp_md *ctx`, which is
not used yet. I will talk about it later. This function returns `XDP_DROP`, which
means we will drop all incoming packets. There are also some other XDP actions
like `XDP_PASS`, `XDP_TX`, `XDP_REDIRECT`.

Finally, the last line formally specifies the license associated with this
program. Some eBPF helpers are accessible only by GPL licensed programs, and the
verifier will use this info to enforce such a restriction.

### Task 1.2: Build and dump the bpf object

After the programming, let's build it with clang:
`$ clang -O2 -g -Wall -target bpf -c xdp_drop.c -o xdp_drop.o`

`-O` Specify which optimization level to use, `-g` could generate debug
information.

You can use `llvm-objdump` to show the ELF format after build. With `-h` you
can see the sections in the object. With `-S` it will display the source
interleaved with the disassembly.

```
$ llvm-objdump -h xdp_drop.o

xdp_drop:       file format ELF64-BPF

Sections:
Idx Name            Size     VMA              Type
  0                 00000000 0000000000000000

$ llvm-objdump -S -no-show-raw-insn xdp_drop.o

xdp_drop:       file format ELF64-BPF


Disassembly of section xdp_drop:

0000000000000000 xdp_drop_prog:
;       return XDP_DROP;
       0:       r0 = 1
       1:       exit
```

The llvm-objdump is very useful if you want to know what the object does without
source code.


### Task 1.3: load the bpf object

*Warn*: do not load it on default interface, please use veth interface for testing.

After building the object, there are multiple ways to load the object.
The easiest way to load it is using `ip` cmd, like
`$ sudo ip link set veth1 xdpgeneric obj xdp_drop.o sec xdp_drop`

But the `ip` cmd doesn't support the BTF([BPF Type Format](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/btf.html))
type map that we will talk later. Although the latest [ip-next](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/iproute2/iproute2-next.git/commit/?id=f98ce50046b433687c0a661b6b9107a0603d1058)
has fixed this issue by adding libbpf support, it's not backport to main line yet.

The recommand way to load XDP object on RHEL is using xdp-loader. Not only
because it depends on libbpf which has full BTF support, but also that's the
only way we can get multiple programs on one interface.

To get Red Hat support for XDP feature, please use `libxdp` based on document
[XDP is conditionally supported in RHEL 8.3 release note](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/8.3_release_notes/new-features#enhancement_networking)

Now let's load it the object on interface `veth1` with `xdp-loader`, `-m sbk` means to use skb mode.
There are some other modes like native, offload. As these modes are not
supported on all NIC driver, we just use skb mode in this article. `-s
xdp_drop` specify to use the section xdp_drop.

`$ sudo xdp-loader load -m skb -s xdp_drop veth1 xdp_drop.o`

### Task 1.4: show the XDP programs

There are also multi ways to show the XDP program we just load:
```
$ sudo xdp-loader status
CURRENT XDP PROGRAM STATUS:

Interface        Prio  Program name     Mode     ID   Tag               Chain actions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
lo               <no XDP program>
ens3             <no XDP program>
veth1                  xdp_dispatcher   skb      15   d51e469e988d81da
 =>              50    xdp_drop_prog             20   57cd311f2e27366b  XDP_PASS
$ sudo bpftool prog show
15: xdp  name xdp_dispatcher  tag d51e469e988d81da  gpl
        loaded_at 2021-01-13T03:24:43-0500  uid 0
        xlated 616B  jited 638B  memlock 4096B  map_ids 8
        btf_id 12
20: ext  name xdp_drop_prog  tag 57cd311f2e27366b  gpl
        loaded_at 2021-01-13T03:24:43-0500  uid 0
        xlated 16B  jited 40B  memlock 4096B
        btf_id 16
$ sudo ip link show veth1
4: veth1@if3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 xdpgeneric qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether ba:4d:98:21:3b:b3 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netns ns
    prog/xdp id 15 tag d51e469e988d81da jited
```

If you load with `ip` cmd, there will only 1 XDP program load. If you load with
`xdp-loader`, there will be 2 programs loaded by default. One is `xdp_dispatcher`,
created by xdp-loader, another is `xdp_drop_prog`, write by us.

From the above result, we can see the `xdp_dispatcher` with id 15 and
`xdp_drop_prog` with id 20.

### Task 1.5: unload the XDP programs

If you use `ip` cmd to load the program, you can use
`$ sudo ip link set veth1 xdpgeneric off` to unload the program. Note you need
to use Correspond xdp flag to unload, e.g. use `xdpgeneric off` if you load it by
`ip link set veth1 xdpgeneric obj ...` or `xdp off` if you load it by `ip link set veth1 xdp obj ...`

Or we can just unload all the programs by `xdp-loader`, `-a` means to unload all
the programs on the interface:
`$ sudo xdp-loader unload -a veth1`

## Task 2: XDP: Drop specific packets

The first example will drop every packet. It is just an intro example and doesn't
have any real meaning. Now let's do some real stuff. Let's try to drop some
specific packets. Like IPv6 packets.

```
#include <linux/bpf.h>
#include <bpf/bpf_helpers.h>
#include <linux/if_ether.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>


SEC("xdp_drop")
int xdp_drop_prog(struct xdp_md *ctx)
{
	void *data_end = (void *)(long)ctx->data_end;
	void *data = (void *)(long)ctx->data;
	struct ethhdr *eth = data;
	__u16 h_proto;

	if (data + sizeof(struct ethhdr) > data_end)
		return XDP_DROP;

	h_proto = eth->h_proto;

	if (h_proto == htons(ETH_P_IPV6))
		return XDP_DROP;

	return XDP_PASS;
}

char _license[] SEC("license") = "GPL";

```
Compare with the first example. We added two more header files `linux/if_ether.h`
and `arpa/inet.h` for struct ethhdr and function htons().

The `struct xdp_md` is also used in this example. It's defined(in linux 5.10) like
```
struct xdp_md {
	__u32 data;
	__u32 data_end;
	__u32 data_meta;
	/* Below access go through struct xdp_rxq_info */
	__u32 ingress_ifindex; /* rxq->dev->ifindex */
	__u32 rx_queue_index;  /* rxq->queue_index  */

	__u32 egress_ifindex;  /* txq->dev->ifindex */
};
```
The packet contents are between `ctx->data` and `ctx->data_end`.
And the data starts with ethernet header, so we assign ethhdr like
```
	void *data = (void *)(long)ctx->data;
	struct ethhdr *eth = data;
```

When accessing the data in `struct ethhdr`, we must make sure we don't access
invalid areas by checking `data + sizeof(struct ethhdr) > data_end`.
This check is compulsory by the [BPF verifer](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/filter.html#ebpf-verifier).

Then if the protocol in ether header is IPv6 with checking `h_proto == htons(ETH_P_IPV6)`,
we will drop it by returning `XDP_DROP`. For others we just return `XDP_PASS`.

## Task 3: MAP: Count the processed packets

In the previous example we dropped IPv6 packets, but how to know how many packets are
dropped? Here we got another BPF feature, MAPS. BPF maps are used to share data
between kernel and userspace. We can update the map data in kernel and read it
from userspace, or vice versa.

Here is an example of new `BTF-defined map`(introduced by upstream [commit abd29c931459](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/netdev/net.git/commit/?id=abd29c931459)).
```
struct {
        __uint(type, BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERCPU_ARRAY);
        __type(key, __u32);
        __type(value, long);
        __uint(max_entries, 1);
} rxcnt SEC(".maps");
```
The map is named as `rxcnt` with type `BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERCPU_ARRAY`. This type
indicates that we will have one instance of the map per CPU core (if you have
4 cores, you will have 4 instances of the map). It will be used to count how
many packets are processed per core. Then we defined the key/value type and
limit the max entries to 1, as we only need to count one number(the received IPv6 packet).
In C code it would look like we defined an array on each cpu with a size of one.
.e.g `unsigned int rxcnt[1]`.

BPF also supports more [map types](https://prototype-kernel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bpf/ebpf_maps_types.html)
 like BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH, BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY, etc.

Then we lookup the value with function `bpf_map_lookup_elem()` and update it.
Here is the full code.

```
#include <linux/bpf.h>
#include <bpf/bpf_helpers.h>
#include <linux/if_ether.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>

struct {
        __uint(type, BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERCPU_ARRAY);
        __type(key, __u32);
        __type(value, long);
        __uint(max_entries, 1);
} rxcnt SEC(".maps");

SEC("xdp_drop_ipv6")
int xdp_drop_ipv6_prog(struct xdp_md *ctx)
{
        void *data_end = (void *)(long)ctx->data_end;
        void *data = (void *)(long)ctx->data;
        struct ethhdr *eth = data;
        __u16 h_proto;
        __u32 key = 0;
        long *value;

        if (data + sizeof(struct ethhdr) > data_end)
                return XDP_DROP;

        h_proto = eth->h_proto;

        if (h_proto == htons(ETH_P_IPV6)) {
                value = bpf_map_lookup_elem(&rxcnt, &key);
                if (value)
                        *value += 1;
                return XDP_DROP;
        }

        return XDP_PASS;
}

char _license[] SEC("license") = "GPL";
```

Now let's name the new program to xdp_drop_ipv6_count.c and build it to
xdp_drop_ipv6_count.o. 

```
$ sudo xdp-loader load -m skb -s xdp_drop_ipv6 veth1 xdp_drop_ipv6_count.o

<receive some IPv6 packets>

$ sudo bpftool map show
bpftool map show
13: percpu_array  name rxcnt  flags 0x0
        key 4B  value 8B  max_entries 1  memlock 4096B
        btf_id 20
19: array  name xdp_disp.rodata  flags 0x480
        key 4B  value 84B  max_entries 1  memlock 8192B
        btf_id 28  frozen
# bpftool map dump id 13
[{
        "key": 0,
        "values": [{
                "cpu": 0,
                "value": 13
            },{
                "cpu": 1,
                "value": 7
            },{
                "cpu": 2,
                "value": 0
            },{
                "cpu": 3,
                "value": 0
            }
        ]
    }
]
```
After loading the object, then send some IPv6 packets to this interface.
With `bpftool map show` we can see the map `rxcnt`'s id is 13. Then
with `bpftool map dump id 13` we could see there are 13 packets
are processed on cpu 0 and 7 packets are processed on cpu 1.

## Task 4: Loader: load XDP objects with custom loader

We can load the XDP objects with `ip` and show the map number with `bpftool`.
But if we want more advanced features(create, read, write maps, attach xdp
programs to interfaces, etc), we need to write the loader ourselves.

Here is an example of how to show the total packets and PPS we dropped.
In this example I hard code a lot of stuff like kernel object name,
section name, etc. These all can be set via parameters in your own code.

The purpose of each function has commented in the code.
```
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <linux/if_link.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <net/if.h>
#include <assert.h>

/* In this example we use libbpf-devel and libxdp-devel */
#include <bpf/bpf.h>
#include <bpf/libbpf.h>
#include <xdp/libxdp.h>

/* We define the following variables global */
static int ifindex;
struct xdp_program *prog = NULL;

/* This function will remove XDP from the link when program exit */
static void int_exit(int sig)
{
	xdp_program__detach(prog, ifindex, XDP_MODE_SKB, 0);
	xdp_program__close(prog);
	exit(0);
}

/* This function will count the per CPU number and print out total
 * dropped packets number and PPS(packets per second).
 */
static void poll_stats(int map_fd, int interval)
{
	int ncpus = libbpf_num_possible_cpus();
	if (ncpus < 0) {
		printf("Error get possible cpus\n");
		return;
	}
	long values[ncpus], prev[ncpus], total_pkts;
	int i, key = 0;

	memset(prev, 0, sizeof(prev));

	while (1) {
		long sum = 0;

		sleep(interval);
		assert(bpf_map_lookup_elem(map_fd, &key, values) == 0);
		for (i = 0; i < ncpus; i++)
			sum += (values[i] - prev[i]);
		if (sum) {
			total_pkts += sum;
			printf("total dropped %10llu, %10llu pkt/s\n",
			       total_pkts, sum / interval);
		}
		memcpy(prev, values, sizeof(values));
	}
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	int prog_fd, map_fd, ret;
	struct bpf_object *bpf_obj;

	if (argc != 2) {
		printf("Usage: %s IFNAME\n", argv[0]);
		return 1;
	}

	ifindex = if_nametoindex(argv[1]);
	if (!ifindex) {
		printf("get ifindex from interface name failed\n");
		return 1;
	}

	/* load XDP object by libxdp */
	prog = xdp_program__open_file("xdp_drop_ipv6_count.o", "xdp_drop_ipv6", NULL);
	if (libxdp_get_error(prog)) {
		printf("Error, load xdp prog failed\n");
		return 1;
	}

	/* attach XDP program to interface with skb mode.
	 * Please set ulimit if you got an -EPERM error.
	 */
	ret = xdp_program__attach(prog, ifindex, XDP_MODE_SKB, 0);
	if (ret) {
		printf("Error, Set xdp fd on iface %d failed\n", ifindex);
		return ret;
	}

	/* Find the map fd from bpf object */
	bpf_obj = xdp_program__bpf_obj(prog);
	map_fd = bpf_object__find_map_fd_by_name(bpf_obj, "rxcnt");
	if (map_fd < 0) {
		printf("Error, get map fd from bpf obj failed\n");
		return map_fd;
	}

	/* Remove attached program when program is interrupted or killed */
	signal(SIGINT, int_exit);
	signal(SIGTERM, int_exit);

	poll_stats(map_fd, 2);

	return 0;
}
```

Set the `ulimit` to unlimited and build the program with flag `-lbpf -lxdp`.
then run the program and we could see the pkt count output.

```
$ sudo ulimit -l unlimited
$ gcc xdp_drop_ipv6_count_user.c -o xdp_drop_ipv6_count -lbpf -lxdp
$ sudo ./xdp_drop_ipv6_count veth1
total dropped          2,          1 pkt/s
total dropped        129,         63 pkt/s
total dropped        311,         91 pkt/s
total dropped        492,         90 pkt/s
total dropped        674,         91 pkt/s
total dropped        856,         91 pkt/s
total dropped       1038,         91 pkt/s
^C
```

## Summary

With this article we know what a XDP program looks like, how to add a BPF map
and how to write customer loader. If you want to learn more about XDP
programming, you can reference to [xdp-tutorial](https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tutorial).
