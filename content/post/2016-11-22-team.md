### Create team interface
1. via cmd
teamd -d -t team0 -c '{ "runner" : {  "name" : "activebackup" }, "link_watch" : {  "name" : "ethtool" } }'
teamdctl team0 port add eth1
teamdctl team0 port add eth2

As you may know the Active State in an LACPDU shows us the state which the
sender thinks the aggregation is in. The Partner State shows what the sender
thinks the receiver's state is.

So the Partner State for the enp132s0f1 per the teamctl output above shows
state flags:

G = Aggregation flag. This is set, indicating the port is available to be used
    in an LACP aggregation
S = LACP Timeout. This is set, indicating a "fast" LACPDU rate should be used
    (one LACPDU per second, versus ~30 seconds if off, a "slow rate)
A = LACP Activity. This is set, indicating the port is in Active mode (versus
    Passive mode)

S = Synchronization. This is not set, indicating the port is not willing to be
    used in LACP aggregation (in standby mode, for example)
C = Collecting. This is not set, indicates whether traffic received will be
    passed on to the host/network
D = Distributing. This is not set, indicates whether the port is going to
    transmit traffic
E = Expired. This is not set, indicates that it has been more than three
    cylces since the port has received an LACPDU from the partner
D = Defaulted. This is not set, indicates that it has been more than six
    cycles since the port has received an LACPDU from the partner. Partner state
    information is forgotten when this happens (the LACP negotiation will have to
    be restarted from scratch)
