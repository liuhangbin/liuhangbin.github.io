1. git clone kpatch repo from `https://github.com/dynup/kpatch.git`
2. config kernel src repo since we need src.rpm package
3. install dependence package
for kpatch `yum install -y gcc kernel-devel elfutils elfutils-devel`
for kpatch-build
```
yum install -y rpmdevtools pesign yum-utils
yum-builddep kernel
debuginfo-install kernel
yum install -y elfutils-devel zlib-devel binutils-devel newt-devel
python-devel perl-ExtUtils-Embed audit-libs-devel numactl-devel pciutils-devel
```
4. generate a patch exactly the same kernel with the one we will build. Kpatch
could not adjust the patch even for a single line. So use 123.el7 to generate
a patch if you want to build a module in 123.el7
5. switch to kpatch folder and run `make; make install`
6. kpatch-build your.patch
7. kpatch load kpatch-your.ko
8. done
