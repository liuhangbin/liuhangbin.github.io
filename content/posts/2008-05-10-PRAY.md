			&nbsp;<wbr>God,grant me the serenity to accept the things
icannot change,courage to change the things i can,and wisdom to
know the difference.Living one day at a time and enjoying one
moment at a time,accepting hardships as the pathway to
peace.Taking,as He did,this sinful world as it is and not as i
would have it,trusting that He will make all things right if i
surrender to His will,that i may be reasonaly happy in this
life,and supremely happy with Him forever in the next.Amen
