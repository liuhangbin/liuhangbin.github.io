			A new turn of english study begin after my school.<br />
Today I met my new english teacher, a high, strong man. He is very
funny(humour),and he speaks english very clearly, also make jokes
lot :)<br />
He gave us some advise about studying english, for example , we
should read the english subtitle but not chinese when watching
American shows/TV. We should read english books and learn words
with a list/sheet. Always try to remember you words list. When you
meet a word not understand, use a english dictroy.
&nbsp;<wbr>A penpail is also a good choose.<br />
We can also write english diaries and send to him, then he will
known what mistakes we made. &nbsp;<wbr>I hope we will have
a good time with him.
